I use the naming convention:

YYYY-MM-DD.Topic.Target

The date usually is the due date for conferences or the submission date, which I push forward as it slips in time i.e., it ends up being the date the thing is finally submitted. If there are major revisions requireing a versionining I usually don't make a new directory, unless it is going to a new place.

Topic - topic of the paper or other identifier (e.g. XTechReport)
Target - journal, conference, or wherever this goes.
